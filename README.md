# Gravities_Comparision

Here is a code to simulate gravities on different celestial bodies. Simulation involves observation of falling objects. Simple drawn circles are falling down with different accelerations depending on gravities. Then the circle is bouncing off the down screen boundary loosing 50% of its speed. In the program i added gravities of sun, earth, mars and moon. I wrote a programme using SFML library. Here is a screen shot of graphical window appearance.
